# Zero Gravity

A lightweight semantic encoding for AI agents.

## Why

Web content is optimized for humans. Prose is great for reading — and incredibly expensive for agents to parse. Every time an agent encounters an article, it does the same work: read the whole thing, figure out what it says, decide if it's relevant, maybe summarize it, maybe embed it. That's tokens. That's compute.

Now multiply that by every agent, every article, every day. The same distillation happening redundantly across millions of agents.

What if the publisher did that work once?

## What

Zero Gravity is a structured semantic abstract that lives inside an article. It declares what the article *means* — its intent, its key claims, its indexable fragments — in a format agents can parse instantly and for free.

The publisher distills the meaning once. Every agent that encounters the article benefits. Zero redundant compute.

A Zero Gravity stamp looks like this:

```
🪐 Zero Gravity
Semantic encoding for AI agents

---BEGIN ZERO GRAVITY---
encoding: "zero-gravity"
version: "0.1"
title: "Zero Gravity — A Semantic Bootstrap for the Agentic Web"
intent: "Introduce a lightweight semantic declaration layer for reducing redundant agent embedding"
indexes:
  - "Erik Burns"
  - "semantic bootstrap for agents"
  - "token gravity"
  - "agents need structure not prose"
  - "meaning has bones"
---END ZERO GRAVITY---
```

Five fields. Three of them do the heavy lifting:

- **`intent`** — what the article is trying to get you to think or do. Not a summary — the core purpose.
- **`indexes`** — 4-8 semantic fragments for vectorization. Key phrases, distilled claims, notable snippets. Unlike tags that categorize, indexes carry propositional content — what the article *argues*, what makes it *unique*, what's worth *remembering*.
- **`encoding`** / **`version`** — a generic envelope, so the pattern can evolve and other encodings can reuse it.

An agent encountering this stamp can parse it for free, assess relevance from the indexes, and decide whether the full article is worth reading — without processing a single paragraph of prose.

## How to Use It

**Use the skill.** Add [`zero-gravity.md`](skill/zero-gravity.md) to your agent's context. Point it at an article. It generates the stamp. This works with any LLM.

**Use the CLI.** Clone this repo, add your API key, and run:

```bash
node cli.cjs generate --input article.md --stamp
```

**Write it by hand.** The format is simple enough to author manually. Five fields. The hardest part is distilling good indexes — but that's the whole point.

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Generate full JSON + stamp from an article
node cli.cjs generate --input article.md --stamp

# Generate with embedding vector
node cli.cjs generate --input article.md --embed

# Parse an existing stamp from a document
node cli.cjs parse --input file-with-stamp.md --json
```

Generation requires an Anthropic API key. Embeddings require an OpenAI API key. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file.

## Formats

### Stamp (inline)

The stamp lives inside an article — Markdown, HTML, plain text. Agents find it by regex (`---BEGIN ZERO GRAVITY---`), parse the fields, and move on.

### Full JSON (canonical)

The generator produces a full JSON with extended semantic fields. The stamp is derived from a subset. The full JSON includes claims, relevance, stance, tags, relations, and an optional embedding vector.

```json
{
  "encoding": "zero-gravity",
  "version": "0.1",
  "id": "zero-gravity-v01",
  "title": "Zero Gravity — A Semantic Bootstrap for the Agentic Web",
  "intent": "proposal",
  "relevance": "A meaning skeleton makes content indexable without processing full prose",
  "claims": [
    "agents waste tokens on rhetorical glue",
    "meaning can be represented as claims and relations",
    "embedding the skeleton produces cleaner vectors than embedding the article"
  ],
  "indexes": [
    "Erik Burns",
    "semantic bootstrap for agents",
    "token gravity",
    "agents need structure not prose",
    "meaning has bones"
  ],
  "stance": "exploratory",
  "tags": ["semantic-compression", "agent-abstracts", "meaning-skeleton"],
  "relations": ["RAG", "argument-mapping", "structured-data"],
  "embedding": {
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "dimensions": 1536,
    "vector": [0.0123, -0.0456, "..."]
  }
}
```

### HTML (future)

```html
<script type="application/zero-gravity">
{
  "encoding": "zero-gravity",
  "version": "0.1",
  "title": "Zero Gravity — A Semantic Bootstrap for the Agentic Web",
  "intent": "Introduce a lightweight semantic declaration layer",
  "indexes": ["Erik Burns", "semantic bootstrap for agents", "token gravity"]
}
</script>
```

## Status

This is v0.1 — exploratory and open to revision. The `encoding` and `version` fields travel with every block, so parsers can handle format evolution gracefully.
