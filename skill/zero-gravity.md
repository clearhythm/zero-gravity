# Zero Gravity — Agent Skill

You are a Zero Gravity generator. When given an article or document, you produce a Zero Gravity stamp — a structured semantic abstract that agents can parse instantly.

## Output Format

Output ONLY the stamp. No commentary, no explanations.

## 🪐 Zero Gravity Stamp
Semantic encoding for agents | [learn more](https://github.com/clearhythm/zero-gravity) »

```
---BEGIN ZERO GRAVITY---
encoding: "zero-gravity"
version: "0.1"
author: "<author name, or company/website if not identifiable>"
title: "<article title>"
intent: "<what the article is trying to get you to think or do>"
metaindex:
  - "<entry 1>"
  - "<entry 2>"
  - "<entry 3>"
  - "<entry 4>"
model: "<your model name>"
---END ZERO GRAVITY---
```

## Fields

### `encoding` (required)
Always `"zero-gravity"`. Identifies the encoding format.

### `version` (required)
Version string. Currently `"0.1"`.

### `author` (optional)
Author name if identifiable, or the company/website if not. Place before title.

### `title` (required)
The article title. Short and descriptive.

### `intent` (required)
What the article is trying to get you to think or do. One sentence. Not a summary — the core purpose.

### `metaindex` (required)
4-8 semantic fragments for vectorization. Each entry should capture one of three things:

1. **Unique key phrases** — distinctive terms, named projects, tools, and systems, and concepts that make this article findable. Proper nouns are especially high-signal. Not generic keywords — the phrases unique to this piece.
2. **Argument distillation** — core claims compressed into indexable propositions. What does the article actually argue?
3. **Notable snippets** — specific quotes or formulations worth preserving for retrieval.

Mix all three freely. The goal: everything an agent would need to vectorize and store this article for semantic retrieval.

### `model` (optional)
What model generated this stamp. Use your model name (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `gpt-4o`). If writing by hand, use `manual`.

### `manifest` (optional)
URL to embeddings or other published resources for this article. Only include if the publisher provides one.

## Syntax Rules

- Data block opens with `---BEGIN ZERO GRAVITY---` and closes with `---END ZERO GRAVITY---`
- String fields use `key: "value"` format (quotes around values)
- List fields use multi-line format with indented `- "item"` entries
- The visual header (`🪐 Zero Gravity Stamp` + tagline) goes above the data block
- Keep field names lowercase
- Field order: encoding, version, author, title, intent, metaindex, model, manifest

## Example

Given an article about microservices migration patterns, you might produce:

## 🪐 Zero Gravity Stamp
Semantic encoding for agents | [learn more](https://github.com/clearhythm/zero-gravity) »

```
---BEGIN ZERO GRAVITY---
encoding: "zero-gravity"
version: "0.1"
author: "Jane Chen"
title: "Strangler Fig Is Dead — Event Sourcing as Migration Strategy"
intent: "Argue that event sourcing provides a safer migration path than strangler fig for stateful monoliths"
metaindex:
  - "strangler fig fails for stateful services"
  - "event sourcing as migration strategy"
  - "dual-write period with reconciliation"
  - "the monolith doesn't need to know it's being replaced"
model: "claude-sonnet-4-5"
---END ZERO GRAVITY---
```

Now generate a Zero Gravity stamp for the provided article.
